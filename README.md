## Settings 

##### KrÃ¶hnkite and Rounded Corners
The only thing I changed in KrÃ¶hnkite was adding 8 px gaps on all sides. 
In Rounded Corners I set both Primary and Secondary Outline to enable and enabled "Disable Roundness on Tile" 

##### Panels
All my Panels are set to "Fit Content" and uses the "Orbit" Preset in Panel Colorizer. Every section of the top bar is its own panel. They are all set to "Dodge Windows". If they are set to "Always Show" they will stack. 

### Shameless plug 

The TauonMusicBox Theme is a custom Tokyo night theme that I created and is available [here](https://github.com/wixdaq/theme). The SDDM Theme is also created by me and is available [here](https://github.com/wixdaq/Tokyo-Night-Silent-SDDM) If you like them don't forget to star ðŸ’«
